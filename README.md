Docker Security Best Practices:
Use Official Base Images:
Always use official and well-maintained base images from trusted sources like Docker Hub. They are regularly updated and maintained for security patches.

Minimize Image Layers:
Reduce the number of layers in your Docker image to minimize attack surfaces and improve security. Each layer increases the potential attack vectors.

Scan for Vulnerabilities:
Use container scanning tools like Clair, Trivy, or Anchore to identify and fix vulnerabilities in your Docker images.

Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:
Run your containers with the least amount of privileges necessary. Avoid running processes as root, and use non-root users where possible.

Use COPY Instead of ADD:
Prefer the COPY instruction over ADD unless you need the additional features of ADD. This reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

Secure Your Docker Daemon:
Configure your Docker daemon to use TLS to secure communication between Docker CLI and the daemon. Limit the Docker daemon's exposure to the network.

Enable Content Trust:
Enable Docker Content Trust (DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1). This ensures that only signed images are used, reducing the risk of image tampering.

GitHub Actions Security Best Practices:
Use Secrets for Sensitive Information:
Store sensitive information such as API keys, access tokens, and passwords using GitHub Secrets. Never expose sensitive information directly in your workflow files.

Restrict Access to Secrets:
Limit access to secrets by providing the minimum required permissions. Only authorized users or workflows should have access to sensitive information.

Use Encrypted Secrets in Workflows:
Avoid printing sensitive information directly in logs. Use expressions like secrets.MY_SECRET to access secrets in workflows.

Regularly Review Access Permissions:
Periodically review and audit who has access to the repository, especially access to secrets. Remove unnecessary access.

Implement Code Scanning:
Leverage GitHub's code scanning feature to automatically find vulnerabilities in your codebase. Use security tools like CodeQL to identify and address security issues.

Enable Dependabot:
Enable GitHub Dependabot to automatically create pull requests to update dependencies when security vulnerabilities are found.

Keep GitHub Actions Updated:
Regularly update GitHub Actions and associated dependencies to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.

Implement Branch Protection:
Use branch protection rules to prevent force pushes and require reviews before merging. This helps prevent accidental or malicious changes to your codebase.
